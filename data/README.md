# Data Directory

## Overview

This directory contains all data assets used in the ontology-aware anomaly detection pipeline.
The layout is designed to separate immutable source data from automatically generated, reproducible artifacts.

## Structure

**raw/** – Original, unmodified data files

- Place the downloaded Diabetes 130-US Hospitals CSV file here as
  `data/raw/diabetic_data.csv`.

- Files in this folder are treated as read-only by the code and should not be edited in place.

**processed/** – Intermediate and preprocessed artifacts

- Created automatically by the preprocessing pipeline (feature matrices, train/test splits, cached encodings, etc.).

- All contents can be regenerated by re-running the pipeline and are therefore excluded from version control (see `.gitignore`).

A minimal example of the expected layout:

```
data/
  raw/
    diabetic_data.csv
  processed/
    # generated artifacts (not committed to git)
```

## Primary Dataset

### Diabetes 130-US Hospitals (1999–2008)

**Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

**Description**:
10 years of inpatient care (1999–2008) from 130 hospitals and integrated delivery networks in the United States, comprising roughly 100,000 encounters and more than 50 variables per record.

**Included information** (non-exhaustive):

- **Patient demographics**: age, gender, race

- **Admission details**: admission type/source, discharge disposition, time in hospital

- **Diagnostic information**: up to three ICD-9 diagnosis codes, procedure codes

- **Treatment**: insulin and other diabetes medications, medication change flags

- **Laboratory results**: HbA1c and glucose test indicators

- **Outcome label**: hospital readmission status (NO, >30, <30)

In this project, the pipeline derives a binary target indicating whether a patient was readmitted within 30 days (y = 1) or not (y = 0), following the standard preprocessing used in the original publication.

## Usage Notes

- **Do not modify** files under `data/raw/` directly; any cleaning or transformation should be implemented in the preprocessing code and written to `data/processed/`.

- Large data files (including the full `diabetic_data.csv`) are excluded from version control for practicality and licensing reasons; only configuration, code, and lightweight examples are tracked.

- To reproduce the experiments, download the dataset from UCI, place it under `data/raw/` as described above, then run the pipeline entry point documented in the main `README.md`.
